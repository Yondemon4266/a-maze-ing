# 📦 Code Reusability and Packaging

We must isolate the core maze generation logic so it can be reused in future projects.

## 🏗️ Module Architecture
- [ ] **Unique Class:** Implement the maze generation as a unique class (e.g., `MazeGenerator`) inside a standalone module.
- [ ] **Data Access:** The module must grant access to the generated maze structure and at least one solution (note: this structure does not have to be the exact same format as the final output text file).

## ⚡ UV Packaging Requirements
- [ ] **Package Name:** The package must be called `mazegen-*` and the file must be located at the root of your git repository.
- [ ] **Allowed Formats:** Both `.tar.gz` and `.whl` extensions are allowed, as generated by the standard build of a Python package  (e.g., `mazegen-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl` ).
- [ ] **Build Source (uv):** We must provide in our Git repository all needed elements to build the package. This means setting up a proper `pyproject.toml` that `uv` can use to build the module.
- [ ] **Evaluation Ready:** During the evaluation, we will be asked to install the needed tools in a virtualenv or equivalent, and build the package again from our sources. We must be ready to demonstrate this using `uv` commands (like `uv venv`, `uv sync`, and `uv build`).

## 📝 Module Documentation
We must provide short documentation (both inside the module and copied into the main `README.md`) describing:
- [ ] How to instantiate and use the generator, with a basic example.
- [ ] How to pass custom parameters (e.g., size, seed).
- [ ] How to access the generated structure and a solution.
