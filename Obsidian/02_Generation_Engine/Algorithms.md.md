# 🧮 Maze Generation Algorithms

The engine is responsible for creating the logical structure of the maze before any visual rendering.

## 🧠 Algorithm Choices
- [ ] **Standard Algorithms:** Famous algorithms used for maze generation include Prim's, Kruskal's, or the recursive backtracker. 
- [ ] **Reproducibility:** The maze must be randomly generated, but reproducibility via a seed is strictly required.
- [ ] **Perfect vs. Imperfect:** If the `PERFECT` flag is activated in the config, the maze must contain exactly one path between the entry and the exit (i.e., a perfect maze). Perfect mazes are directly related to spanning trees in graph theory.
- [ ] **Bonus Idea:** We could support multiple maze generation algorithms as a bonus feature.
