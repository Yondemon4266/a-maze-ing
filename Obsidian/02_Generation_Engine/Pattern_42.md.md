# 🎨 The "42" Pattern

The maze generation must include a specific visual easter egg inside the labyrinth structure.

## 🧩 Implementation Rules
- [ ] **Shape:** The maze must contain a visible "42" drawn by several fully closed cells. 
- [ ] **Isolation Exception:** These fully closed cells act as an exception to the "no isolated cells" rule.
- [ ] **Size Constraints:** The "42" pattern may be omitted if the maze size is too small to contain it. 
- [ ] **Error Handling:** <span style="color: red;">If the maze is too small for the pattern, the program must print an error message on the console.</span>
